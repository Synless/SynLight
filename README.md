This software on the computer side processes screenshots and sends data to a NodeMCU microcontroller via Wifi (UDP). The microcontroller then drive individually addressable RGB LEDs on the rear of the screen, to match the color of its edges. This allows for a nice experience while watching movies, but also while working on a daily basis, by limiting visual fatigue.
